Lucifer is angry with God because Lucifer sinned and was thrown to Hell permanently while human spirits sinned but are given a chance to go back to God (Heaven) through Jesus Christ. For that Lucifer calls God as a bias creator (person) and in fact the crucifixion that is the torture of our Lord Jesus was carried out not <p style='color:blue;'>by the Jews and Roman soldiers as we feel and understand it but by the demons of the Kingdom of hell in the image of human beings as a revenge to God’s son and hence God the Father. Therefore, Lucifer plans to send as many human spirits to hell as possible to frustrate God the Father.<br> <a href="EditAdmin.php?edit=<?php echo $row['username'];?>" class= "edit-btn"> <img src="images/houe.jpg" alt="image" class="photo" style="width: 100%; height: 50%; margin-top: 1px;"></a>tree she would have the KNOWLEDGE of GOOD and BAD?

If we do not repent and believe in His words, then we shall be thrown to hell permanently as has been the case of Lucifer (Satan). This is </p>then the real eternal death, the death of human spirit.
